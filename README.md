# QFlashCards

A simple virtual flashcards app in written in C++ with Qt.

I'm creating the mostly for my own use in studying, though its also its own learning excercise, 
being my first ever Qt project, not to mention my first C++ project in a while.

My hope is that it will allow students to easily create and use their own virtual flash cards,
store them for later use, and allow three levels study: simple review, multiple choice, and 
free responce.  That is to allow varying levels of difficulty and learning, recall being a 
more difficult task and deeper level of learning than recognition.  In addition, it will randomize 
presentation as this also improves the depth and flexibility of learning be eliminating the 
priming effect that can occur with constant order stimuli.

This is currently entirely WIP, and not remotely useable -- check back later if you want a 
usable copy, perhaps there may even be links to binaries then.

This project is free and open source, and presented in the hopes that it will interesting and/or 
useful, but with no warranty or guarantee of any kind whatsoever.  It is released under the
