# QFlashCards

A simple virtual flashcards app in written in C++ with Qt. I created the mostly for my own use 
in studying.  It is my first useful, native-code gui app.

My hope is that it will allow students to easily create and use their own virtual flash cards,
store them for later use, and allow three levels study: simple review, multiple choice, and 
free responce.  That is to allow varying levels of difficulty and learning, recall being a 
more difficult task and deeper level of learning than recognition.  In addition, it will randomize 
presentation as this also improves the depth and flexibility of learning be eliminating the 
priming effect that can occur with constant order stimuli.
