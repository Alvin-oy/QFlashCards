<H1>QFlashCards</H1>

<P align="justified">This is a small, independly made virtual
flashcards app based on Qt, created for the authors own use
and as a wey to start learning Qt.</P>

<H2>How to Use</H2>

<H3>File Menu</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>New</B> will create a new (empty) set of flashcards.</LI>
<LI><B>Load</B> will load a set of flashcards from a *.qfcml file (open the file).</LI>
<LI><B>Save</B> will save the current set of flashcards to a file.</LI>
<LI><B>Save As</B> will save the current set of flashcards with a new filename.</LI>

</UL>

<H3>Use Menu</H3>

<P align="justified"><B><U>Review</U></B></P> will allow you to read through
the fashcards.  They will be in randomized order (this is good for your learning).</P>

<P align="justified"><B><U>Quiz</U></B></P> will show you cards with the top part
(the question or word) visible and a place below for you to fill in the second
part (answer, definition, or whatever it is).  This is where the real learning
occurs; practice is the secret, you must practice remembering and answering.  The
order is always random.  The random order improves learning, espcially making
it easier to remember in different situations.</P>

<H3>Create Menu</H3>

<P align="justified"><B><U>Add Cards</U></B></P> will allow create new cards.
You will see that it has two empty text boxes you can type in.  The top box
is for things like questions or vocabulary words; it is the part you will see
in quiz mode.  The bottom box is for things like answers or definitions; it is
what you must retype in quize mode.</P>

<P align="justified"><B><U>Edit Cards</U></B></P> will let you go through cards
you alread have and make changes.  You can edit the text boxes and then click
the [Save] button to save chages to that card.  You can also get rid of a card
by clicking [Delete], but be careful, you can't undo delete (you would have to
make that card again with Add Cards).</P>
